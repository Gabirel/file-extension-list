# Organised collection of common file extensions

This project maintains reusable collections of common file extensions
categorised per typology. It can be used by any program to quickly distinguish
between file types. It acts faster than mime/type or libmagic recognition, but
is of course slower.

## Organisation

Each collection is a file named after a generic typology stored in `data/`:
- archive ::  archives and disc images
- video ::  moving images
- audio ::  playable audio
- text ::  text in human languages
- code ::  code in machine languages
